## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

After looking at the average number of refrigerators for different household incomes, there does seem to be a slight increase in number of refrigerators in the households with higher incomes. However, the differences are not as big as one might think. The average numbers are all between 1.1 and 1.9 refrigerators. So now, we want look at other characteristics of refrigerators that may vary more significantly by income. By doing this, we can try to determine what kinds of refrigerators to market to what income demographics. We were expecting to see a greater difference in number of refrigerators in a household based on income, but although the difference is small, we can still utilize this information because those in higher income brackets are still buying relatively more refrigerators, which is relevant to our sales.
